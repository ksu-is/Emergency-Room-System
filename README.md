# Emergency-Room-System

A system that can help hospital staff keep track of ER patient records. 
---

Keeping track of patient records is a very important task and having those records in an organized program helps hospital staff save time and resources. This python application makes that process easier to manage and even provides data analysis for areas of improvement. The program only allows access to staff with a certain level of clearance since patient records must be kept in confidentiality.

The hospital staff will be able to add a patient record or search for a patient record using full name or patient ID number but wonâ€™t be allowed to remove records. It also calculates the average time a patient has to wait between entering the waiting room and receiving assistance by a medical professional. This application helps improve the efficiency of Emergency Rooms. If the calculated average time for the day is higher than the standard rate that is set in the program, it will give the user some helpful tips on how to manage the ER better so that there is less waiting time. 

I will be using a related code from a program that keeps school records. The program is found at this link: https://github.com/sudipsingh04/Student-Record-System/blob/master/Program.py.
This will help me in creating the code that is needed to add and search for a patient record using an ID number. 

There is also some useful tips here: https://www.daniweb.com/programming/software-development/threads/445107/average-time-calculation that will help me in caluculating the average waiting time.
